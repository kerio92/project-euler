#The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385
#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025
#Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
#Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
